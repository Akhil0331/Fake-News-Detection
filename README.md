# Fake-News-Detection
# Project Overview
The Fake News Detection project aims to automatically classify news articles as Real or Fake using machine learning techniques. In today’s digital world, misinformation spreads quickly through online platforms, creating confusion and affecting society. This project helps identify misleading or false information by analyzing textual data and predicting its authenticity.

# Problem Statement
Fake news has become a major problem due to the rapid growth of social media and digital publishing. Manual verification is time-consuming and not scalable. Hence, there is a need for an automated system that can classify news articles accurately and quickly.

# Objectives
To preprocess and clean news text using NLP techniques.
To convert textual data into numerical form using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
To train machine learning models that can classify fake and real news.
To evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
To build a simple interface where users can enter news text and get a prediction.
